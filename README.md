## Description
This is a simple API meant to resemble an ordering system, or at the very least hold data for orders and customers.
It uses express.js for the routing, mongodb to store data, and swagger for documentation.

I keep getting the error 'Cannot GET /' no matter what URL I use to test my code in postman. I tried to fix this for hours, and was ultimately unable to.
I believe there is an error in my routing, but I unfortunately cannot find it in time to submit this assignment.
